If you say my singing is off key, my love  You will hurt my feelings, don't you see, my love?  I wish I had an ear like yours, a voice that would behave  All I have is feeling and the voice God gave  You insist my music goes against the rules  Yes, but rules were never made for love sick fools  I wrote this little song for you, but you don't care  It's a crooked song, ah, but, all my heart is there  The thing that you would see if you would play your part  Is even if I'm out of tune I have a gentle heart  I took your picture with my trusty Rolleiflex  And now all I have developed is a complex     Possibly in vain, I hope you'll weaken, oh my love  And forget those rigid rules that undermine my dream  Of a life of love and music with someone  Who'll understand  That even though I may be out of tune  When I attempt to say how much I love you  All that matters is the message that I bring which is:  My dear, one, I love you
