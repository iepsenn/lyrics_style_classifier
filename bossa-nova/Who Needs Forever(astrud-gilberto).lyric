Who needs forever Love me today Let's forget tomorrow It's too far away So hold me Don't waste this moment Let's live this moment like it's the last Time goes so fast    Love shouldn't linger Love shouldn't wait When fates allow a choice of now or never Who needs forever    Love shouldn't linger Love shouldn't wait When fates allow a choice of now or never Who needs forever    Forever Forever
