I wake up every night I can't find anyone to pray Somewhere in the light Changing alone I'm afraid on the side Looking out for the lies to say Someone has the light Fading off us    I came to fight I came to fight over you Don't want your lies Don't want your lies, I need truth I came to fight I came to fight over you No one will try No one will try if that's true    I won't wait for the sign I can't find anyone to stay But there's something in the light Saving our lives    I came to fight I came to fight over you Don't want your lies Don't want your lies, I need truth I came to fight I came to fight over you No one will try No one will try if that's true    And I can face you now No, I won't break you down If I can find you, I won't hurt you It's not what I'd do    I came to fight I came to fight over you Don't want your lies Don't want your lies, I need truth I came to fight I came to fight over you No one will try No one will try if that's true
