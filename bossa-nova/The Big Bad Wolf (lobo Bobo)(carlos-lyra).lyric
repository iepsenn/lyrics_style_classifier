Once there was a Big Bad Wolf In search of someone good to meet. Cruising down the street, One day he wheeled right up Beside a mighty cute    Red Riding Hood in bathing suit Who heard him give His horn a toot. With manner debonair, He grinned and smoothed his hair.    But Riding Hood thought twice On her granny's good advice: "Remember, when a wolf seems nice You say to him, 'No dice'!"    How he pleaded, vowed love, And even promised to reform. The sight of her in her swim suit Would melt the heart of almost any brute!    But Big Bad Wolf was not too cool, When he failed to guess That girl's I.Q. She saw through his disguise, And said she liked His big blue eyes!    The moral of this tale shows, You see, how fate takes shape. Red Riding Hood now wears a new Fur collar on her cape!
