Was once a lady broken-hearted and undone  She nearly lost her faith she'd ever meet her mate one day,  Though love was nearby, in fact, about to make its entrance  Later in the script, but in the meantime...     Behind her smile lived a loneliness  No Leonardo could hide  When hearts collide  Can they ever repair?  Love never lasted off-screen;  How could she fly without wings?  Losing each new leading man  To those unhappy endings.     Behind her tears ebbed an emptiness  Vast as an ocean, as blue,  But no one knew  Of the weather within.  Cinema aimed at the heart,  But none of the loves scenes were real:  Simply rehearsing a part  She'd forgotten how to feel.     Enter the one whom the author created especially for her;  The focus blurs  The composer writes strings.  Cinema straight from the heart,  Shot on location within,  We see the past fade to black;  We see happiness begin.
