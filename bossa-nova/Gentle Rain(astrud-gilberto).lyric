We both are lost and alone in the world Walk with me in the gentle rain Don't be afraid, I've a hand for your hand and I will be your love for a while    I feel your tears as they fall on my cheek They are warm like the gentle rain Come little one you have me in the world and our love will be sweet Very sweet    Come little one, you got me in the world and our love will be sweet Very sweet, very sad Like the gentle rain Like the gentle rain
