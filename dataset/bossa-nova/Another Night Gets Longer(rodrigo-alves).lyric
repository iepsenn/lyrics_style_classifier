Last night I thought I heard this voice  it was calling, whispering my name  But the silence came  Then the sweet sleeping sound of the pouring rain  Thrilling sights, a source of desires  the unexpectable fire comes  So I'll have my drink, gonna have my time  Gonna kick up my heels and this night will be mine     This time I will not fall back  And this time I will not regret  Of the choices made, or the things unsaid  'Cause I know that a storm's gonna come to wash it all away     (chorus)  People dance, people talk, people shine  While another night gets longer  Betting dimes, losing rhymes, it's alright  While another night gets longer  You'll find me alone sometimes * Following the lights or hidden in the dark  But my life for life just gets stronger ** While another night gets longer  (and this night gets longer) **    Bright lights - there I walk in disguise  But my home is heaven, it's my paradise  But when home is far  Sometimes destination is another bar     But I can't play the clown  Or a hero lost in a strange town  I'm a simple man, got my songs to write  And I've got these old movies in black and white     And I take my cup of tea  I'm addicted to a Parker's theme  When the 30's are here, got a little peace  And a picture of life in the way it was meant to be     (chorus)         I'll go again * Spread my thoughts thought this big city motion ** I'll go again * Run back home and put music in my emotions ** and play it on and on again **    Vocals: * Eduardo Falashi ** Andr√© Matos other lines: Cristopher Clark
