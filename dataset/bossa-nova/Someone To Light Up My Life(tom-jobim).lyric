Go on your way with a cloudless blue sky above May all your days be a wonderful song of love Open your arms and sing of all the hidden hopes you're ever treasured And live out your life in peace Where shall I look for the love to replace you? Someone to light up my life Someone with strange little ways Eyes like a blue autumn haze Someone with your laughing style And a smile that I know will keep hauting me endlessly Sometimes in stars or the swift flight of sea-birds I catch a moment of you That's why I walk all alone Searching for something unknown Searching for something or someone to light up my life That's why I walk all alone Searching for something unknown Searching for something or someone to light up my life
