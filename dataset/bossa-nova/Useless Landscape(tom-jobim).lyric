There's no use Of a moonlight glow Or the peaks where winter snows    What's the use of the waves that will break In the cool of the evening What is the evening Without you It's nothing    It may be You will never come If you never come to me What's the use of my wonderful dreams And why would they need me Where would they lead me Without you To nowhere Just nowhere
