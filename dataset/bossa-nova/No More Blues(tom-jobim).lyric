No more blues  I'm going back home  No more blues  I promise no more to roam  Home is where the heart is  The fun and parties  My heart's been right there all along  No more fears  And no more sighs  No more tears  I've said my last good-byes  If trouble beckons me I swear I'm going to refuse  I'm going to settle down  There'll be no more blues     Everyday when I am far away  My thoughts turn homeward, forever homeward  I've travelled round this world in search of happiness  But all the happiness I found was in my hometown     No more blues  I'm going back home  No more blues  I'm through with all my wanderings  Now I'll settle down and never roam  Find a man and make a home  When we settle down  There'll be no more blues  Nothing but happiness  When we settle down  There'll be no more blues
