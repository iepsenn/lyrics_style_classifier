Take this fainted heart Take these tainted hands Wash me in your love Come like grace again    Even when my strength is lost I’ll praise you Even when I have no song I’ll praise you Even when it’s hard to find the words Louder then I’ll sing your praise I will only sing your praise    Take this mountain weight Take these ocean tears Hold me through the trial Come like hope again    Even when the fight seems lost I’ll praise you Even when it hurts like hell I’ll praise you Even when it makes no sense to sing Louder then I’ll sing your praise I will only sing your praise    I will only sing your praise I will only sing your praise I will only sing your praise    And my heart burns only for you Your are all, you are all I want And my soul waits only for you And I will sing till the morning has come    Lord my heart burns only for you Your are all, you are all I want And my soul waits only for you And I will sing till the miracle comes    I will only sing your praise I will only sing your praise    Even when the morning comes I’ll praise you Even when the fight is won I’ll praise you Even when my time on earth is done Louder then I’ll sing your praise I will only sing your praise
