Love is not a place To come and go as we please It's a house we enter in Then commit to never leave    So lock the door behind you Throw away the key Work it out together Let it bring us to our knees    Love is a shelter In a raging storm Love is peace In the middle of a war If we try to leave; May God send angels to guard the door No, Love is not a fight But its something worth fighting for    Some love is a word That they can fall into. But when they're falling out Keeping that word is hard to do    Love is a shelter In a raging storm Love is peace In the middle of a war If we try to leave; May God send angels to guard the door No, Love is not a fight But its something worth fighting for    Love will come to save us If we'll only call He will ask nothing from us But demand we give our all    Love is a shelter In a raging storm Love is peace In the middle of a war If we try to leave; May God send angels to guard the door No, Love is not a fight But its something worth fighting for    Yes, I will fight for you Would you fight for me? It's worth fighting for
