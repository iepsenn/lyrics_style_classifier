There’s a grace when the heart is under fire Another way when the walls are closing in And when I look at the space between Where I used to be and this reckoning I know I will never be alone    There was another in the fire Standing next to me There was another in the waters Holding back the seas And should I ever need reminding Of how I’ve been set free There is a cross that bears the burden Where another died for me There is another in the fire    All my debt left for dead beneath the waters I’m no longer a slave to my sin anymore And should I fall in the space between What remains of me and this reckoning Either way I won’t bow to the things of this world ('cause I know) Yeah, I know I will never be alone    There is another in the fire Standing next to me There is another in the waters Holding back the seas And should I ever need reminding The power that set me free There is a grave that holds no body And now that power lives in me    There is another in the fire, whoa ooh There is another in the fire, whoa ooh There is another in the fire, whoa ooh There is another in the fire, whoa ooh (I can see)    I can see the light in the darkness As the darkness bows to Him I can hear the roar in the heavens As the space between wears thin I can feel the ground shake beneath us As the prison walls cave in Nothing stays between us Nothing stays between us    There is no other name but the name that is Jesus He who was, and still is, and will be through it all So come on lay in the space between All the things unseen and this reckoning I know I will never be alone (I know) I know I will never be alone    There'll be another in the fire Standing next to me There'll be another in the waters Holding back the seas And should I ever need reminding How good You've been to me I'll count the joy from every battle 'Cause I know that's where You'll be (and I can see the light)    I can see the light in the darkness As the darkness bows to Him I can hear the roar in the heavens As the space between wears thin I can feel the ground shake beneath us As the prison walls cave in Nothing stays between us Nothing stays between    There'll be another in the fire Standing next to me There'll be another in the waters Holding back the seas And should I ever need reminding How good You've been to me I'll count the joy from every battle 'Cause I know that's where You'll be    I'll count the joy from every battle 'Cause I know that's where You'll be I'll count the joy from every battle 'Cause I know that's where You'll be I'll count the joy from every battle 'Cause I know that's where You'll be I'll count the joy from every battle 'Cause I know that's where You'll be
