O how high would I climb mountains If the mountains were where You hide O how far I'd scale the valleys If You graced the other side    O how long have I chased rivers From lowly seas to where they rise Against the rush of grace descending From the source of its supply    Cause in the highlands and the heartache You’re neither more or less inclined I would search and stop at nothing You're just not that hard to find    I will praise You on the mountain And I will praise You when the mountain's in my way You’re the summit where my feet are So I will praise You in the valleys all the same No less God within the shadows No less faithful when the night leads me astray You're the heaven where my heart is In the highlands and the heartache all the same    O how far beneath Your glory Does Your kindness extend the path From where Your feet rest on the sunrise To where You sweep the sinner's past    O how fast would You come running If just to shadow me through the night Trace my steps through all my failure And walk me out the other side    For who could dare ascend that mountain That valleyed hill called Calvary But for the One I call Good Shepherd Who like a lamb was slain for me    I will praise You on the mountain And I will praise You when the mountain's in my way You're the summit where my feet are So I will praise You in the valleys all the same No less God within the shadows No less faithful when the night leads me astray You're the heaven where my heart is In the highlands and the heartache all the same    Whatever I walk through Wherever I am Your Name can move mountains Wherever I stand    And if ever I walk through The valley of death I'll sing through the shadows My song of ascent    Whatever I walk through Wherever I am Your Name can move mountains Wherever I stand    And if ever I walk through The valley of death I'll sing through the shadows My song of ascent My song of ascent    From the gravest of all valleys Come the pastures we call grace A mighty river flowing upwards From a deep but empty grave    So I will praise You on the mountain And I will praise You when the mountain’s in my way You’re the summit where my feet are So I will praise You in the valleys all the same No less God within the shadows No less faithful when the night leads me astray You're the heaven where my heart is In the highlands and the heartache all the same
