Gaye, Won't you let me have a say In the way you behave, I won't last another day If you decide to go away.    CHORUS: You're the tray of nice things I upset yesterday, The display of bright rings I let slip away.    ****    Oh Gaye, You allay my every fear In a most extraordinary way, If I thought that I could find my way without you I would not ask you to stay.    CHORUS: You're the tray of nice things I upset yesterday, The mainstay of my dreams That I let slip away.    ****    Gaye, Won't you let me have a say In the way you behave, I won't last another day If you decide to go away.    Don't go away, Oh please stay, Don't go away, Please stay.
