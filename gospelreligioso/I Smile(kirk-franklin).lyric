(I dedicate this song to recession Depression and unemployment This song's for you)    Today is a new day but there is no sunshine Nothing but clouds and it's dark in my heart And it feels like a cold night Today is a new day, but where are my blue skies? Where is the love and the joy that you promised me You tell me it's alright! (I'll be honest with you!) I almost gave up but a power that I can't explain Fell from heaven, like a shower now (When I think how much better I'm gonna be when this is over)    I smile, eventhough I'm hurt see I smile I know God is working so I smile Eventhough I've been here for a while (What you do?) I smile, (come on in!) smile! It's so hard to look up when you look down Sure would hate to see you give up now (God's people) You look so much better when you smile so smile! (Now every day ain't gonna be perfect But it still doesn't mean today won't have purpose Come on!)    Today is a new day but there is no sunshine Nothing but clouds and it's dark in my heart And it feels like a cold night (It ain't easy but) Today is a new day but tell me Where are my blue skies? (Where is that love?) Where is the love and the joy that you promised me You tell me it's alright! (The truth is) I almost gave up but a power that I can't explain (The holy ghost power ya'll!) Fell from heaven like a shower now (Now I know we've been hurt you all but still.)    I smile (come on!), eventhough I'm hurt see I smile I know God is working so I smile Eventhough I've been here for a while (Still!) I smile (hallelujah!) Smile! It's so hard to look up when you've been down Sure would hate to see it when you give up now (Because people) You look so much better when you smile! (Let's go)    Smile for me! Can you just smile for me? (Whatever you're in right now) Smile for me! (smile) Can you just smile for me? (Ah! And the people say)    Oh, oh, oh! You look so much better when you oh, oh, oh! You look so much better when you oh, oh, oh! You look so much better when you oh, oh, oh! (I say!) You look so much better when you oh, oh, oh!

You look so much better when you oh, oh, oh! (always remember) You look so much better when you smile! (Come on!)    I almost gave up (almost gave up!) But a power that I can't explain (but the holy ghost power ya'll) Fell from heaven like (came down from heaven) a shower now (Hardship, difficulties) right now (Tears, this is what I do)    I smile Eventhough I'm hurt see I smile (Whatever is good) I know God is working working so I smile (All things are working!) Eventhough I'm needed for a while (Still!) I smile, smile! (Hallelujah!) It's so hard to look up when you've down (I know something right now!)
