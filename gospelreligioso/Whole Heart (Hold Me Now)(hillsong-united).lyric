Hold me now in the hands that created the heavens Find me now where the grace runs as deep as Your scars You pulled me from the clay, set me on a rock Called me by Your Name And made my heart whole again    Lifted up, and my knees know it’s all for Your glory That I might stand with more reasons to sing than to fear You pulled me from the clay, set me on a rock Called me by Your Name And made my heart whole again    So here I stand High in surrender I need You now Hold my heart, now and forever my soul cries out    Once I was broken But You loved my whole heart through Sin has no hold on me, ‘cause Your grace holds me now    And that grace owns the ground where the grave did Where all my shame remains left for dead in Your wake You crashed those age-old gates You left no stone unturned You stepped out of that grave And shouldered me all the way    Healed and forgiven, look where my chains are now Death has no hold on me ‘Cause Your grace holds that ground    And Your grace holds me now, Your grace holds me now Your grace holds me now, Your grace holds me now    So here I stand, high in surrender I need You now Hold my heart, now and forever, my soul cries out    And Your grace holds me now, Your grace holds me now
