I can't believe the news today I can't close my eyes and make it go away How long How long must we sing this song? How long, how long?    Tonight we can be as one Tonight Broken bottles under children's feet And bodies strewn across a dead end street But I won't heed the battle call It puts my back up, puts my back up against the wall    Sunday, bloody sunday Sunday, bloody sunday Sunday, bloody sunday Sunday, bloody sunday    And the battle's just begun There's many lost but tell me who has won? The trenches dug within our hearts And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart    Sunday, bloody sunday Sunday, bloody sunday How long How long must we sing this song? How long, how long?    Tonight we can be as one Tonight    I wipe your tears away I wipe your tears away I wipe your tears away (Sunday, bloody sunday) I wipe your tears away (Sunday, bloody sunday)
