In the space between what's wrong and right, You will find me waiting for you. All your fortresses go down in the night. To the dawn I'll see you through.    'Cause I know, that you know, You're all over me now. And it's clear, it will show, Your curtains will close. But if your heart is cold, my sheets are warm. I will shelter you through the storm. I will shelter you all through the storm.    The answers aren't so easy to find, The questions will have to do. 'Cause I've lost myself deep in your life, My only fix is you.    'Cause I know, that you know, You're all over me now. And it's clear, it will show, Your curtains will close. But if your heart is cold, my sheets are warm. I will shelter you through the storm. I will shelter you all through the storm.    Saying what I am, what we are, It's a start towards the truth. Taking my breath with each day, All I can stand in my heart it's you.    In the space between what's wrong and right, You will find me waiting for youâ€¦
