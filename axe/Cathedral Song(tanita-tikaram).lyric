I saw from the Cathedral You were watching me Yes I saw from the Cathedral What I should be    So take my time And take my lies 'Cos all the others They wanna take my life    And I watch with an intent, basic Well it's the same for you You hold your hand And it's all fine, laced and What would you make me do?    So take my time And take my lies 'Cos all the others They wanna take my life    Serious for the winter time To wrench my soul Whole cotton, whole cotton ears But I know there must be Yes I know there must be Yes I know there must be a place to go    And you saw me from the Cathedral Well I'm an ancient heart Yes you saw me from the Cathedral And we are just falling apart You catch me, I am tired I want all that you are    And I saw from the Cathedral You were leaving me Yes I saw from the Cathedral You could not see to see    So take my time And take my lies 'Cos all the others They wanna take my life
