Oh lord I'd like to know where she is now If she thinks about me or not Oh not, Oh lord I wanna give her all my love My life, my heart And please her    I wonder if I'm right? Or must I try to forget her?

Be near me, darling I miss you darling Oh bring me, darling Your sweet kiss, darling    Oh jah! Oh jah! I'd like to be near her Oh jah! Oh jah! I miss and love her
