There was a time, i used to look into my father's eyes In a happy home, i was a queen i had a gold throne Those days are gone, now the memories are on the wall I hear the songs from the places where i was born    Up on the hill across the blue lake, Thats where i had my first heart break I still remember how it all changed My father said Don't you worry, don't you worry child See heaven's got a plan for you Don't you worry, don't you worry now Yeah!    There was a time, i met a boy of a different kind We ruled the world, Thought i'll never lose him out of sight, we were so young I think of him now and then Still hear the song reminding me of a friend
