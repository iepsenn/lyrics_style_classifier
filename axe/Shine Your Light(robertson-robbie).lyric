The cry of the city like a siren's song Wailing over the rooftops the whole night long Saw a shooting star like a diamond in the sky Must be someone's soul passing by    These are the streets Where we used to run where your Papa's from These are the days Where you become what you become These are the streets Where the story's told The truth unfolds Darkness settles in    Shine your light down on me Lift me up so I can see Shine your light when you're gone Give me the strength To carry on, carry on    Don't wanna be a hero Just an everyday man Trying to do the job the very best he can But now it's like living on borrowed time Out on the rim, over the line Always tempting fate like a game of chance Never wanna stick around to the very last dance Sometimes I stumble and take a hard fall Loose(?) hold your grip off the wall    Shine your light down on me Lift me up so I can see Shine your light when you're gone Give me the strength to carry on Carry on    I thought I saw him walking by the side of the road Maybe trying to find his way home He's here but not here He's gone but not gone Just hope he knows if I get lost    Shine your light down on me Lift me up so I can see Shine your light when you're gone Give me the strength to carry on Carry on
