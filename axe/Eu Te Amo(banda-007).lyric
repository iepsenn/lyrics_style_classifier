So many lovers, too many nights Face in the mirror that keeps you alive So close together, so far apart I'm so afraid without you    Rain on the river, I'll never cross Wind on the ocean, the feeling is lost I still believe that you cry for me Will I survive without you?    Like a fool, I was waiting Like a fool, for you to come back Fool, I was standing alone in the rain Like a fool, I was dreaming Like a fool, to lose you this way And now I'm just fooling myself    Foi tanto que eu te amei e não sabia Que pouco a pouco eu, eu te perdia Eu te amo    E aquele louco amor inesquecível Tirar do coração é impossível Eu te amo    Te amei demais, enlouqueci Brigas banais, te perdi    O tempo já passou E eu não consigo calar meu coração E as vezes digo que te amo    Like a fool, I was waiting Like a fool, for you to come back Fool, I was standing alone in the rain Like a fool, I was dreaming Like a fool, to lose you this way And now I'm just fooling myself
