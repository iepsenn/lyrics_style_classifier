I can tell by your eyes that you've probably Been crying forever And the stars in the sky don't mean nothing To you, they're a mirror    I don't want to talk about it How you broke my heart If I stay here just a little bit longer If I stay here, won't you listen To my heart? Whoa, my heart    If I stand all alone, will the shadow Hide the color of my heart? Blue for the tears, black for the night's fears The stars in the sky don't mean nothing To you, they're a mirror    I don't want to talk about it How you broke my heart If I stay here just a little bit longer If I stay here, won't you listen To my heart? Whoa, my heart My poor old heart Whoa, my heart    I don't want to talk about it, how you broke my heart If I stay here just a little bit longer If I stay here, won't you listen To my heart?
